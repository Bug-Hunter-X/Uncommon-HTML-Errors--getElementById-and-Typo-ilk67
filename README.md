# Uncommon HTML Errors
This repository demonstrates a couple of uncommon errors that can occur in HTML, specifically related to DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

**Error 1:** Attempting to access an element that does not exist in the DOM before it is added will throw an error.

**Error 2:**  A simple typo in `getElementById` (using `getElementByid`) will prevent the correct element from being selected.

This example highlights the importance of careful coding and thorough testing when working with HTML and JavaScript.
